# First Homework

For this homework, our task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it cleaner.


## Getting Started

I'm not quite sure how others are going to access my repository, so here is the SSH key if needed:  git@github.com:mila-mamat/homework-1.git

### Contents
* index.html
* assets folder
   * CSS folder
      * style.css
   * images folder
      * brand-awareness.png
      * cost-management.png
      * digital-marketing-meeting.jpg
      * lead-generation.png
      * online-reputation-management.jpg
      * search-engine-optimization.jpg
      * social-media-marketing.jpg
      
## What are the changes?
1. Webpage title is changed from website to Horiseo Homepage.

2. Comments are added in both html and css file to give extra tips on structure.

3. changed the tag names from  < div> to  < nav>, < header>,  < main> ( < section>), < aside> and  < footer>
  * The original  < div> tags, replaced above, used class names like "header","footer" to style in css. Thus the class selectors in CSS is replaced by the element selectors accordingly.
  
  
4. Removed the unnecessary classes in  < main> and  < aside>, like "search-engine-optimization", "benefit-lead",etc. 
  * Summarized the CSS codes under main section{} and aside div{}
  * IDs are untouched as navigation bar on top is linked through IDs
  * original html file didn't add ID to the first section. Fixed. 
  
5. Some properties used throughout the webpage, like font color and font family, are summarized on the top under body{}


## What went wrong?
I dont know why, the font size of my navigation bar is 20px as the original one, but it visually looks bigger to me. Will double check later.

## What other changes I would like to make?
1.
